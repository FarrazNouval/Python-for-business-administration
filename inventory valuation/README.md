# Inventory Valuation
This project automates inventory valuation using Python. It utilizes a Jupyter Notebook format for easy visualization and interaction with the code.

## FIFO method.
It aims to simplify and improve the process of inventory valuation using the FIFO (First-In, First-Out) method. By automating calculations with Python, the project offers several benefits:

1. Increased Efficiency: Eliminate manual calculations and save time.
2. Reduced Errors: Mitigate the risk of human error in calculations.
3. Transparency: Easily understand the logic behind the calculations.
4. Scalability: Easily handle large datasets with ease.

## other methods (standard, LIFO, weighted average, etc.) are coming soon
